# Uni_Info_Database
A PL/SQL RDBMS as an example of university information system that includes very detailed information about educational and administrative systems. 
This project is a part of the projects I am going to work on during my internship.

•DB.sql file includes the RDMBS system's PL/SQL code.

•ER_Diagram_RDBMS.png file includes the entity relationship diagram of the RDBMS system created by me.

*Note: The 00Tables.sql file in ORACLE PL-SQL includes another RDMBS that have been made before by another software specialist, however, it includes a few tables added by me.
Other named files containing functions, views, sequences, procedures and triggers are all created by me.*
