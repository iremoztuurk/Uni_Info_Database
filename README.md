# Uni_Info_Database
A PL/SQL RDBMS as an example of university information system that includes very detailed information about educational and administrative systems. 
This project is a part of the projects I am going to work on during my internship.

*Note: The 00Tables.sql file in ORACLE PL-SQL includes another RDMBS than have been made before by another software specialist, however, it includes a few tables added by me.
Other named files containing functions, views, sequences, procedures and triggers are all created by me.*
